# Plants vs. Zombies Fusion Edition: Secondary Creation & Plugin Development

This repository contains my learning notes and development resources for creating a fusion edition of Plants vs. Zombies, focusing on secondary creation (fan-made) content and plugins using C# and Unity. It includes custom plants, game mechanics, modding techniques, and plugin development for enhancing gameplay. These notes are compiled from community resources, Unity documentation, modding tutorials, and hands-on experiments. This is an ongoing project, and contributions are welcome!

## Overview

Plants vs. Zombies (PvZ) is a beloved tower defense game, and this repository explores the creation of a "fusion edition" that combines elements from various PvZ versions or introduces original fan-made content. Using C# and Unity, the focus is on secondary creation (fan-made mods) and plugin development to extend gameplay, such as custom plants, zombies, mechanics, and tools.

Key topics include:
- **Secondary Creation**: Designing custom plants and zombies with unique abilities, animations, and behaviors.
- **Fusion Mechanics**: Blending gameplay elements from different PvZ versions (e.g., combining PvZ 1 and PvZ 2 mechanics) or creating hybrid levels.
- **Plugin Development**: Building tools, mods, or extensions to enhance PvZ gameplay, such as level editors or balance tweaks.
- **Unity Integration**: Implementing PvZ-style mechanics in Unity, including tower defense logic, AI, and UI.
- **Modding Basics**: Working with existing PvZ modding frameworks, asset pipelines, and community tools.
- **Best Practices**: Optimizing performance, ensuring compatibility, and maintaining balance in fan-made content.

This repository is aimed at modders, game developers, and PvZ enthusiasts interested in creative fan projects.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders for easy navigation:

- **/secondary-creation/**: Notes and examples for designing custom plants and zombies (e.g., new abilities, stats, or visual effects).
- **/fusion-mechanics/**: Guides on blending gameplay elements, such as hybrid levels or cross-version mechanics.
- **/plugins/**: Documentation and code for developing PvZ plugins, including level editors, cheat tools, or gameplay mods.
- **/unity-implementation/**: Unity-specific notes and scripts for recreating PvZ mechanics, including grid systems, projectile physics, and AI.
- **/examples/**: Unity scenes, C# scripts, and modding examples, such as a custom plant with unique attack patterns.
- **/resources/**: Links to PvZ modding communities, Unity tutorials, asset creation tools, and modding frameworks.
- **/images/**: Screenshots, concept art, Unity editor visuals, and diagrams to illustrate development processes.

Each note is written in Markdown format for readability. Files are named descriptively, e.g., `custom-plant-scripting.md` or `plugin-level-editor.md`.
